/// Node structure to represent the internal structure of a router.
///
/// A router is simply a `Node` which doesn't have any parent nodes,
/// which allows for the recursive structure of the tree. Each
/// `Node` can have a value of the generic type, which is the value
/// returned when routing occurs.
///
/// Every `Node` also has an associated `Matcher` which is used
/// to test for compatibility when routing (because not every node
/// is applicable on a given segment order). This `Matcher` is
/// automatically provided to the `Node` at creation time and is
/// calculated by the routing system.
///
/// Lastly, a `Node` can have child instances to represent the
/// recursive structure of a router. These children are stored in
/// a `Vec` as there's currently no logical way to index them into
/// a more suitable structure. If a `Node` has no children, the
/// containing vector does not require any memory allocation. Any
/// memory will be allocated lazily, and should remain minimal in
/// most standard cases (as it depends on the allocator in use).
