//! HTTP routing components based on an Usher `Router`.
//!
//! This module exposes the `HttpRouter` structure, which represents a
//! generic `Router` in a more HTTP appropriate way. Rather than the
//! typical insertion functions, this router exposes HTTP verbs as the
//! names of functions to provide a simple API for mapping HTTP requests.
//!
//! To activate this extension, use the `"web"` Cargo feature.

/// with this structure simply providing a more HTTP friendly API for ergonomics.

/// To construct a router this way, HTTP verbs must be used as there must be a
/// verb associated with each request. There is currently no way to match any
/// verb, although this will potentially be improved at some point in future.
